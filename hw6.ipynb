    "> **Note:** You may do some supervised learning (as covered in M3 and M4), however, this should not be the _only_ thing(s) you do. We definitley want to see DS workflow/life-cycle (**M1**), lots of EDA (**M2**) and a discussion of ethical issues (**M6**):\n",

    "* [M5] Sentiment Analysis (if applicable - depends on problem/dataset)\n",
    "* **[M6] Ethical Thinking for DS**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main focus of this project is on the first three modules [M0]-[M2], as well as the ethical consderations for DS from [M6]. In particular, it will be helpful to review **Lab 2 & hw2 (Analyzing the MoMA Data)** first. Most of the things you will do in this midterm project are explained in `Lab2` and `hw2`. Then, review the other labs and hws to recap the  general workflow of our DS approaches to the various problems we have worked on so far. This will help you to be prepared for all the steps in this project, so that you do not miss anything. \n",

    "In gernal, you should feel free to import any package that we have previously used in class; you might want to also experiemnt with or use other packages. Ensure that all plots have the necessary components that a plot should have (e.g. axes labels, a title, a legend). \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, note that this assignment is more like a project than a typical homework and it will have a slightly different structure than the hws in the past. One of the reasons why Jupyter Notebooks are so popular in the field is because you can really treat them like notebooks to explain your findings as you discover them. In this assignment, we provide some **Problem** stubs following the EDA/DS workflow and you will need to fill in the analysis and structure as you go. Note that you will be partially graded on the presentation (_cleanliness, clarity, comments_) of your notebook so make sure you [Marie Kondo](https://lifehacker.com/marie-kondo-is-not-a-verb-1833373654) your notebook before submitting it.\n",

    "The data contains information about rides in Boston, Massachusetts and the weather information corresponding to the day of the ride. The data is most likely from Uber and Lyft. The owner of the data does not specify how the data was obtained. There are 693071 examples and 57 features. The features describe each ride by its ride type, location, date, price, and weather-related information such as temperature, precipitation, and humidity. The features have a variety of data types, from integers and floats to objects like string. The only feature with NaN values, however, is the price feature, where only 637976 out of 693071 are non-null. Some of the categorical features have categories that are not very interpretable, such as the 'product_id' which contains strings of letters and numbers in half of the category names"

    "The data details numerous information about each Uber/Lyft trip in Boston. The owner of the dataset, who is a masters student studying data science, does not specify where he collected the data. The data has 57 features and 693071 examples. The features describe each ride by its ride type, location, date, price, and weather-related information such as temperature, precipitation, and humidity. There are many data types in the list of features, from strings to integer and floats. Not all categorical features are comprised of strings, for there are ordinal categories, such as the 'id' feature. The only feature with NaN values is the price feature, where 55095 out of 693071 are NaN. Although the other features do not explicitly have NaN values, some categorical features do not have interpretable category names, as in the example of the 'product_id' feature, where half of the examples have readable category names such as \"lyft_premier,\" while the other half have uninterpretable category names. I assume that the other half with uninterpretable category names are associated with Uber, since there are approximately equal number of Uber and Lyft rides in the data. The point is, it is important to double-check that the features have consistent, interpretable category names, even if they do not contain NaN values. It would be hard to extract meaningful conclusions if we use those features, since we would not be able to interpret the result without comprehendable category names. The data is also limited to winter season, because as the code reveals, the range of the rides is between november and december. This consequently restricts the range of weather-related features, such as temperature. The small range of such features can limit the significance of those features. There is also discrepancy between features that may seem related at first. For example, the 'short summary' and 'long summary' columns have similar categories, such as 'Overcast' and 'Overcast throughout the day,' but have considerable difference in their frequencies. "
