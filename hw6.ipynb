    "* [M5] Sentiment Analysis (if applicable - depends on problem/dataset)\n",

In particular, it will be helpful to review **Lab 2 & hw2 (Analyzing the MoMA Data)** first. Most of the things you will do in this midterm project are explained in `Lab2` and `hw2`. Then, review the other labs and hws to recap the  general workflow of our DS approaches to the various problems we have worked on so far. This will help you to be prepared for all the steps in this project, so that you do not miss anything. \n",

    "\n",
    "Additionally, note that this assignment is more like a project than a typical homework and it will have a slightly different structure than the hws in the past. One of the reasons why Jupyter Notebooks are so popular in the field is because you can really treat them like notebooks to explain your findings as you discover them. In this assignment, we provide some **Problem** stubs following the EDA/DS workflow and you will need to fill in the analysis and structure as you go. Note that you will be partially graded on the presentation (_cleanliness, clarity, comments_) of your notebook so make sure you [Marie Kondo](https://lifehacker.com/marie-kondo-is-not-a-verb-1833373654) your notebook before submitting it.\n",
